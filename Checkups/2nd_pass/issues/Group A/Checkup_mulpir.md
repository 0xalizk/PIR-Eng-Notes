**[\[^1\]](../../../../Schemes/Group%20A%20-%20FHE%20Based%20PIR/mulpir_2019/mulpir_2019_notes.md#user-content-fn-1-2338c4e4aeb53ff41fb25f54fb3bbba0)** — Footnote attributes the circular security requirement for bootstrapping to "Section 4, p. 10," but the circular security statement appears on p. 2 of the PDF ("Also circular security assumption to get fully homomorphic encryption"); p. 10 discusses Theorem 1 and additional procedures without explicitly mentioning circular security.

**[\[^26\]](../../../../Schemes/Group%20A%20-%20FHE%20Based%20PIR/mulpir_2019/mulpir_2019_notes.md#user-content-fn-26-2338c4e4aeb53ff41fb25f54fb3bbba0)** — Footnote cites "Section 4.1, p. 10" for the "Multiplying GSW ciphertexts by plaintext matrices" discussion, but this heading and the quoted passage ("the 'noiseless ciphertext' M* has E' = 0 ...") appear at the top of p. 11, not p. 10.

**[\[^27\]](../../../../Schemes/Group%20A%20-%20FHE%20Based%20PIR/mulpir_2019/mulpir_2019_notes.md#user-content-fn-27-2338c4e4aeb53ff41fb25f54fb3bbba0)** — Footnote cites "Section 1.2, p. 4" for the SealPIR rate quote, but the sentence "the SealPIR results from [ACLS18, Fig. 9] indicate a rate of roughly 1/1000" is in the final paragraph of Section 1.1 (still on p. 4), before the Section 1.2 heading.

### MINOR Issues

- [\[^2\]](../../../../Schemes/Group%20D%20-%20Client%20Dependent%20Preprocessing/singlepass_2024/SinglePass_2024_notes.md#user-content-fn-2-5bd150e08106206446586363f5f9ca08): Footnote says "Section 4 (p.10): MIR [30] is listed as one of three novel state-of-the-art client preprocessing PIR schemes benchmarked against." The PDF lists Checklist [21], TreePIR [23], and MIR [30] — that is three other schemes, not "three novel" ones; Checklist is from 2021, not novel at the time. Wording slightly misleading but the factual core is correct.

- [\[^8\]](../../../../Schemes/Group%20D%20-%20Client%20Dependent%20Preprocessing/singlepass_2024/SinglePass_2024_notes.md#user-content-fn-8-5bd150e08106206446586363f5f9ca08): Footnote cites "Section 2.2.1 (p.5)" and quotes "Unlike previous schemes, [PRFs] will not be necessary to argue security." The actual PDF text on p.5 in Section 2.2.1 says "unlike previous schemes, they will not be necessary to argue security" (referring to PRFs discussed in the preceding sentence). The bracketed interpolation [PRFs] is a reasonable editorial clarification but not a direct quote — minor attribution style issue.

- [\[^9\]](../../../../Schemes/Group%20D%20-%20Client%20Dependent%20Preprocessing/singlepass_2024/SinglePass_2024_notes.md#user-content-fn-9-5bd150e08106206446586363f5f9ca08): Footnote says "Appendix A (p.16)" for seed storage. The relevant text is in Footnote 7 on p.16 of the PDF, which discusses storing only the seed. The footnote's paraphrase is accurate but the precise location is a PDF footnote, not the main Appendix A text. Minor location precision issue.

- [\[^19\]](../../../../Schemes/Group%20D%20-%20Client%20Dependent%20Preprocessing/singlepass_2024/SinglePass_2024_notes.md#user-content-fn-19-5bd150e08106206446586363f5f9ca08): Footnote cites "Figure 3, Query step 4-5 (p.9)" but S_refresh is defined in Query step 4 alone. Step 5 is the swap step. The r_i values are sampled in step 3, not step 4. Minor step numbering imprecision.

- [\[^20\]](../../../../Schemes/Group%20D%20-%20Client%20Dependent%20Preprocessing/singlepass_2024/SinglePass_2024_notes.md#user-content-fn-20-5bd150e08106206446586363f5f9ca08): Footnote cites "Section 1.2 (p.3)" and quotes "we send the column that ind belongs to to Server 1, replacing p_1(2) with a random element." The PDF text on p.3 says "we send the column that ind belongs to to Server 1, replacing p_1(2) with a random element" — this is from the intuition section with a concrete example (N=16, Q=4). The footnote uses it to describe general S_query construction, which is a slightly informal citation for a general protocol detail.

- [\[^24\]](../../../../Schemes/Group%20D%20-%20Client%20Dependent%20Preprocessing/singlepass_2024/SinglePass_2024_notes.md#user-content-fn-24-5bd150e08106206446586363f5f9ca08): Footnote says "Appendix A (p.17)" and paraphrases the hint update swap. The PDF on p.17 says "we let h_k = h_k XOR DB_i[p_i(k)] XOR DB_i[p_i(v)]" — the notes say "h_k = h_k XOR DB_i[p_i(k)] XOR DB_i[p_i(v)], effectively removing the old element from this hint's position and adding the new one." The editorial gloss ("effectively removing...adding") is not in the PDF — it is an added interpretation. Accurate but not a pure quote.

- [\[^39\]](../../../../Schemes/Group%20D%20-%20Client%20Dependent%20Preprocessing/singlepass_2024/SinglePass_2024_notes.md#user-content-fn-39-5bd150e08106206446586363f5f9ca08): Footnote says "Figure 4 (p.10)" and quotes text about other schemes beating DPF "after 50+ queries." The actual PDF text on p.10 says "Results show that whereas other schemes start beating DPF after 50+ queries, the total end-to-end time of SinglePass is already better even when performing two queries." The quote is accurate, but the notes' preceding interpretation says SinglePass beats DPF "after just 2 queries (approximate, from chart)" — the PDF says "even when performing two queries," meaning at 2 queries SinglePass is already better, not that it takes 2 queries to break even. Minor nuance in interpretation.

- [\[^41\]](../../../../Schemes/Group%20D%20-%20Client%20Dependent%20Preprocessing/singlepass_2024/SinglePass_2024_notes.md#user-content-fn-41-5bd150e08106206446586363f5f9ca08): Footnote says "Appendix C (p.19)" and quotes "SinglePass achieves 50-100x better preprocessing time and approximately 80x better storage across the board, with similar query time." The PDF on p.19 in Appendix C says "SinglePass achieves 50-100x better preprocessing time and approximately 80x better storage across the board, with similar query time." However, the exact wording in the PDF is slightly different — the PDF says "we will see that SinglePass achieves 50-100x better preprocessing time and approximately 80x better storage across the board, with similar query time" and additionally notes the bandwidth tradeoff. The quote presented as direct is actually lightly condensed from the original. Minor.

- [\[^43\]](../../../../Schemes/Group%20D%20-%20Client%20Dependent%20Preprocessing/singlepass_2024/SinglePass_2024_notes.md#user-content-fn-43-5bd150e08106206446586363f5f9ca08): Footnote cites "Section 4 (p.13)" but the blocklist benchmark discussion and Table 2 reference are in Section 6 (p.13) ("Benchmarking for Dynamic Databases"), not Section 4. The text "we provide a benchmark of SinglePass and Checklist for the blocklist application studied in Checklist" appears on p.13 within Section 6's context. Minor section number error.

- [\[^48\]](../../../../Schemes/Group%20D%20-%20Client%20Dependent%20Preprocessing/singlepass_2024/SinglePass_2024_notes.md#user-content-fn-48-5bd150e08106206446586363f5f9ca08): Footnote cites "Footnote 6 (p.13)" and quotes about cuckoo hashing with "a 2x overhead." The actual PDF Footnote 6 on p.13 says "using cuckoo hashing it could be translated to a keyword PIR scheme with a 2x overhead [34]." The notes say "our single pass scheme is a pure PIR scheme that only supports index queries" before the cuckoo hashing part — this first clause is paraphrased from the footnote body but presented as a direct quote. Minor paraphrase-vs-quote issue.

- [\[^52\]](../../../../Schemes/Group%20D%20-%20Client%20Dependent%20Preprocessing/singlepass_2024/SinglePass_2024_notes.md#user-content-fn-52-5bd150e08106206446586363f5f9ca08): Footnote says "Appendix A, Footnote 7 (p.16): Storing the inverse permutation alongside the forward permutation has constant overhead; in some scenarios it may be beneficial to omit the inverse to save space (paraphrase of Footnote 7)." The actual Footnote 7 on p.16 says "We can store the inverse along with the permutation with constant overhead. In practice, for some scenarios, it might be beneficial to not store the inverse in order to save space. In those cases, the client time would be O(Q + N/Q). This is the only place where the inverse is used for that static scheme. For the updatable scheme, we require the inverse to get O(1) update operations." The paraphrase omits the O(Q + N/Q) complexity detail and the updatable-scheme distinction. Minor completeness issue.

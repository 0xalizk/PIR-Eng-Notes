**[\[^6\]](../../../../Schemes/Group%20B%20-%20Stateless%20Single%20Server%20PIR/pirouette_2025/Pirouette_2025_notes.md#user-content-fn-6-5bb1e5e04ae71c5d295cff8e57a9300d)** — Citation attributes the quote "Phase 1-3 of the Pirouette protocol operate over R and rely on the hardness of RLWE for security" to Section 4.1 (p.8), but this statement appears on p.5 in the preliminaries (Section 2.3/2.4 area), not in Section 4.1.

**[\[^18\]](../../../../Schemes/Group%20B%20-%20Stateless%20Single%20Server%20PIR/pirouette_2025/Pirouette_2025_notes.md#user-content-fn-18-5bb1e5e04ae71c5d295cff8e57a9300d)** — The cited PDF text says response sizes are "around 3 KB" (Section 5.2, p.10), but the notes present "~2 KB" as the primary response size figure in the Communication Breakdown; Table 7 shows "2 KB" as a separate entry, so the discrepancy is between the text and the table within the PDF itself, but the citation mixes both without clarifying which is authoritative.

**[\[^24\]](../../../../Schemes/Group%20B%20-%20Stateless%20Single%20Server%20PIR/pirouette_2025/Pirouette_2025_notes.md#user-content-fn-24-5bb1e5e04ae71c5d295cff8e57a9300d)** — The claim that "The parallel execution table contains a transcription error where offline communication values (e.g., 91 MB) appear in the computation rows for T-Respire" is editorial commentary about the PDF's Table 7 layout rather than a verifiable factual citation; the PDF's Table 7 does not contain such an error.

**[\[^43\]](../../../../Schemes/Group%20B%20-%20Stateless%20Single%20Server%20PIR/pirouette_2025/Pirouette_2025_notes.md#user-content-fn-43-5bb1e5e04ae71c5d295cff8e57a9300d)** — Citation says "Abstract (p.1)" but the satellite-to-ground communication reference appears in the Introduction (Section 1), not the Abstract; both are on p.1 but are distinct sections.

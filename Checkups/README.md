## Checkups

Footnote validation reports for the engineering notes. Each checkup reads every footnoted claim in a group's notes files, looks up the cited page/section in the source PDF, and classifies the citation as correct, minor issue, or incorrect.

**Note: We have not yet checked all groups. Only Groups A and B have been validated so far.**
